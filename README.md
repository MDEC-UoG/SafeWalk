# SafeWalk

This repository is for the Android and iOS code of the SafeWalk mobile application. https://csaonline.ca/safewalk

This will be an open-source project to create the applications allowing university students to request SafeWalk's services at the touch of a button without the need to make a phone call.

To contribute:
  1. Create a branch off of `development`
  2. Make code changes and commits
  3. Push your commits to the branch and make a pull request into `development`
  4. Kyle will review your pull request and will make suggestions or approve it, so it can be merged into `development`
